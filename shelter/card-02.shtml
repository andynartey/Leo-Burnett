   <p>Shelter exists to help the housing market serve society better. This is a lobbying remit that goes far beyond the coal-face of street homelessness, and we needed to raise public awareness of the perils of the current unsustainable approach to housing overall.</p>
<p>
We created striking and award-winning work in a range of media. <br/>'House of Cards' - dramatising the fragility of the housing market<br/> (this won over 60 creative awards, including Gold at Campaign and Cannes); 'Inflation Adjusted' - demonstrating the un-affordability of housing; and 'Disappearing Houses' - exploring the cruel <br/>randomness of repossession.  </p>
<p>
In two years we've achieved our goal. In fact, forum posts around <br/>UK homelessness have risen by over 1600%.</p>
