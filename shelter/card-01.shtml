<p>For over forty years Shelter has worked tirelessly for the right of <br/>every UK citizen to have a place they can call home. </p>

<p>But in 2008 they had a problem: the public assumed Shelter was<br/> trying to address street homelessness alone. </p>

<p>We helped raise awareness that the issues are much more<br/> complex than that, and Shelter's role much broader. </p>
