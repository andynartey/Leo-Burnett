   <p>The home improvement category is fiercely competitive, the main players fighting it out with promotions, discounts and deals. Little wonder, then, that consumers saw little to differentiate Homebase from its competitors.</p>

<p>We took the term 'Home Improvement' and gave it a meaning beyond the purely functional by stressing the emotional importance of Home in people's lives: 'Home' as a place of personal refuge; 'Improvement' about transforming your special space into something wonderful and individual.  </p>

<p>Homebase exists to transform any space, however unlikely,<br/> into a wonderful home. </p>
