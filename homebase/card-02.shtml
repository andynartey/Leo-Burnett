   <p>Can you turn a wintry Carlisle railway station into a warm <br/>and vibrant living space? It's a question we set out to discover<br/> by doing it for real and then filming it. </p>

<p>Platforms became gardens, living rooms and kitchen areas.<br/> Chandeliers and wallpaper adorned the station,<br/> flooring was laid on bare concrete.  </p>

<p>And was it a success? Passengers alighted from their trains <br/>to marvel at the transformation, enjoying a wonderful moment<br/> of 'home' before going on to their own homes. <br/> A moment of magic,courtesy of Homebase, shared by almost <br/> 50,000 viewers on YouTube.</p>
