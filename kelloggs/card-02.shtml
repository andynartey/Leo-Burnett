  <p>By 2009 Crunchy Nut was the UK's third biggest cereal brand.<br/> But while sales were strong, Crunchy Nut's long-standing campaign idea, 'Ludicrously Tasty', was getting tired. Making breakfast irresistible needed a new creative approach. </p> 

<p>In a nutshell, how could we inject some fun, vibrancy and charm <br/>back into the work?</p>

<p>Our idea was a breakfast TV presenter called Bruce Bowls, who's constantly being distracted by his love for Crunchy Nut. <br/>Played by Rob Brydon, one of Britain's best-loved comedians, our new campaign is already making the advertising as irresistible <br/>as Crunchy Nut itself.    </p>
