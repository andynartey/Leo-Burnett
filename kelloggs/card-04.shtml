<p>Special K had always been associated with quick weight loss,<br/> but in 2011 that's changing. With the launch of a free personalized online weight-loss service helping women with their long-term weight journeys, Special K is evolving into a brand that inspires women to <br/>feel fantastic about their body.</p>

<p>Focussing on women's perennial post-December struggles, it seemed fitting to feature that icon of female fashion, amazing-fitting jeans. </p>

<p>Launched in January with a positive spin and a tone of female empowerment, Our 'Ode To Jeans' campaign has already done <br/>something very special for Special K. The commercial boosted conversions to the plan by 30% in the first seven days, <br/>the myspecialK.co.uk site attracting 121,536 visits.</p>
