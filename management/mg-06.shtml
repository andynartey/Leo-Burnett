    <p>Inspired by this, we defined a new Brand Purpose for Daz:
        <br />
        <em>To make peoples' everyday lives a little bit, well, brighter</em></p>
    <p>and created our very own Soap Opera - 'Cleaner Close'. Not only was this packed with the usual affairs, crime and adultery, it also provided a fabulous platform to talk about Daz, via a holistic media strategy with a remit to entertain rather than inform.</p>
    <p>This turned our relationship with consumers from 'dull' to 'dazzling' with greater branded cut-through, higher advertising involvement, improved brand image ratings and significant brand switching, resulting in higher value share and a significant increase in ROI.</p>
