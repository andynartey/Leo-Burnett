  <p>Roads are the single biggest killer of teenagers in the UK. But we found that simply asserting this fact did little to change behaviour. </p>

<p>If we were going to grab teenagers' attention and save lives,<br/>  we had to find a way to talk their language.  We decided to let them<br/> speak for themselves by creating an ad shot by teenagers for <br/> teenagers on a mobile - an advertising first. </p>

<p>Within two weeks of its launch, over a third of teens in the UK had seen the ad. 95% of them said it made them think again about road safety.
