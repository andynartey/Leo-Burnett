  <p>The biggest factor in road injuries and fatalities in the UK is human error. We misjudge speed, underestimate the consequences of our road behaviour and ignore the impact of drink and drugs on our driving ability. Think! exists to improve self-awareness on the roads.</p>

<p>Since 2000, Think! has helped save over a thousand lives and prevent over eighteen thousand serious road injuries.  The economic value exceeds &pound;4bn from a media investment totalling less then &pound;100m. </p>
<p>
We're proud to have played our part with some highly effective and widely awarded creative work, and we're proud of the IPA Effectiveness Award we won in 2011 for our contribution to road safety.</p>
