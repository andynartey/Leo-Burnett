<p>Unlike drink driving, people didn't think that drugs impaired their driving, didn't know the penalties involved, and didn't realise police <br/> could spot drug drivers and test them. </p>

<p>We focused on the one thing that drug drivers couldn't argue with <br/> - the involuntary effect that drugs have on the eyes. By turning eyes into the 'breathalyser' of a new generation of drug drivers, misconceptions about drug driving began to be overturned. </p> 

<p>And the result? Two thirds of adults were aware of the campaign and half of all adults now believe the police will be able to identify drug drivers by looking at their eyes. A sea-change in social behaviour. </p>
