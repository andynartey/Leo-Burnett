<p>Despite (and perhaps as a result of) being exposed to adult content <br/> on the internet, in games and on multi-channel TV, research showed that children still had limited appreciation of the serious consequences of being involved in an accident. </p>
<p>
To counter this, we created the 'Tales Of The Road' campaign - a series of cautionary stories designed to give the ritual of road safety new meaning and show that disregard for road safety can lead to major injury and emotional repercussions. </p>
<p>
The campaign has created unprecedented awareness amongst <br/> kids and has seen monthly web visits eclipse previous campaigns<br/>  by a margin of three to one.</p>
