  <p>As well as sourcing mostly from the UK and Ireland, McDonald's is committed to raising awareness of the vital role of British farms.  </p>

<p>The idea behind this commercial is that the weather helps British and Irish farmers produce many of the high quality ingredients that end up in your local McDonald's. </p>

<p>Delighting the public that McDonald's are supporting the local economy.  And reassuring them, too, about the quality of McDonald's food. </p>
